              I&#39;ve successfully designed and implemented chatbots using
              cutting-edge technologies like OpenAI API, Python, Pinecone
              database, RAG architecture, and Lang Chain. I&#39;ve contributed
              to projects for reputable institutions such as the CSTU,
              demonstrating my ability to create intelligent and informative
              conversational agents. My experience in generative AI and chatbot
              development showcases my proficiency in NPL, machine learning, and
              data management. I have a deep understanding of RAG (Retrieval
              Augmented Generation) architecture, which allows chatbots to
              access and process relevant information from large datasets. By
              leveraging AI tools like OpenAI&#39;s, I&#39;ve been able to
              develop chatbots that can generate human-like text, answer
              questions, and complete a variety of tasks with high accuracy.
