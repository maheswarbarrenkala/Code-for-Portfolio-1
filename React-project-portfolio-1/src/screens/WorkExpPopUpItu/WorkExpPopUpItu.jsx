                At International Technological University (ITU), I bridged the
                gap between user experience (UX) design and full-stack
                development, spearheading improvements across various platforms.
                <br />
                Elevating User Experience (UX): I identified crucial areas for
                improvement within the ITU website, Education Management System
                (EMS), and my.ITU.edu. By focusing on UX, I enhanced information
                architecture, navigation, and data visualization. These
                optimizations significantly improved accessibility and
                information clarity, positioning ITU as a leader in providing
                detailed information for prospective students.
                <br />
                Full-Stack Expertise &amp; User Interface (UI) Design: I
                leveraged my full-stack development skills and strong front-end
                expertise to enhance student and staff support. This included
                building user-friendly interfaces (UI) for various applications,
                prioritizing usability and accessibility for a seamless user
                journey.
                <br />
                Beyond Technical Skills:&nbsp;&nbsp;I demonstrated initiative
                and trust by providing valuable IT assistance to University
                President Yau. Additionally, my leadership skills were
                highlighted during my tenure as President of the Student
                Government Association (SGA).
                <br />
                Technical Acumen: Rounding out my skillset, I possess experience
                in deploying and maintaining applications on AWS cloud
                environments using automation tools. This showcases my ability
                to manage IT infrastructure effectively.
