                As a skilled software architect with a focus on advanced
                software development methodologies, I designed and developed the
                Document Control System, a comprehensive solution for managing
                and securing sensitive documents. I employed a robust software
                architecture, incorporating UML, flowcharts, and architectural
                diagrams to ensure a clear and efficient system design.
                Leveraging cloud computing and networking technologies, I
                created a scalable and secure platform that effectively controls
                user access to documents based on their roles and permissions.
                The system maintains a comprehensive log of document activity,
                including who uploaded, accessed, edited, or deleted files. My
                expertise in advanced software architecture, coupled with my
                understanding of cloud technologies, enabled me to deliver a
                robust and reliable document control solution that safeguards
                sensitive information and streamlines workflow processes.
