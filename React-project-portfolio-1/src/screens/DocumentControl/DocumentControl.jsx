              As a skilled software architect with a focus on advanced software
              development methodologies, I designed and developed the Document
              Control System, a comprehensive solution for managing and securing
              sensitive documents. I employed a robust software architecture,
              incorporating UML, flowcharts, and architectural diagrams to
              ensure a clear and efficient system design. Leveraging cloud
              computing and networking technologies, I created a scalable and
              secure platform that effectively controls user access to documents
              based on their roles and permissions. The system maintains a
              comprehensive log of document activity, including who uploaded,
              accessed, edited, or deleted files. My expertise in advanced
              software architecture, coupled with my understanding of cloud
              technologies, enabled me to deliver a robust and reliable document
              control solution that safeguards sensitive information and
              streamlines workflow processes.
