              I&#39;ve successfully tackled a wide range of challenging
              projects, including fake news detection, stock market prediction,
              and gender recognition using voice. My expertise in deep learning
              frameworks and techniques, such as neural networks, has enabled me
              to develop sophisticated models that can analyze complex data,
              identify patterns, and make accurate predictions. I&#39;ve applied
              my knowledge of machine learning algorithms to solve real-world
              problems, demonstrating my ability to leverage AI to drive
              innovation and solve complex challenges. My proficiency in neural
              networks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
              recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and generative adversarial
              networks
              <br /> (GANs), has been instrumental in developing cutting-edge AI
              solutions.
