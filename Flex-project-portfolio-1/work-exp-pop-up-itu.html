              >At International Technological University (ITU), I bridged the gap between user experience (UX) design
              and full-stack development, spearheading improvements across various platforms.<br />Elevating User
              Experience (UX): I identified crucial areas for improvement within the ITU website, Education Management
              System (EMS), and my.ITU.edu. By focusing on UX, I enhanced information architecture, navigation, and data
              visualization. These optimizations significantly improved accessibility and information clarity,
              positioning ITU as a leader in providing detailed information for prospective students.<br />Full-Stack
              Expertise &amp; User Interface (UI) Design: I leveraged my full-stack development skills and strong
              front-end expertise to enhance student and staff support. This included building user-friendly interfaces
              (UI) for various applications, prioritizing usability and accessibility for a seamless user journey.<br />Beyond
              Technical Skills:&nbsp;&nbsp;I demonstrated initiative and trust by providing valuable IT assistance to
              University President Yau. Additionally, my leadership skills were highlighted during my tenure as
              President of the Student Government Association (SGA).<br />Technical Acumen: Rounding out my skillset, I
              possess experience in deploying and maintaining applications on AWS cloud environments using automation
              tools. This showcases my ability to manage IT infrastructure effectively.<br /><br /></span
